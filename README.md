# Passionfruit

Passionfruit creates desktop widgets such as wallpapers, status bars, and application launchers for wayland. Written in C using cairo and pango, it is designed to be lighter than using frameworks like gtk and qt in order to be more flexible for features such as animations and irregular shapes.

This is currently a work in progress, and is designed to meet my personal desktop needs. I do plan to improve it to become more modular and customizable in the future.
